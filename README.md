# 🏠 PRODIGY_ML_01 — House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Welcome to **PRODIGY_ML_01**, a machine learning project that predicts **house prices** based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.  
This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful implementation of **Linear Regression** using **Python, Scikit-learn, and Pandas**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this task, we build a **Linear Regression model** that learns the relationship between housing features and their prices.  
By training on the **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset from Kaggle, the model predicts the **Sale Price** of a house given its area and room details.
